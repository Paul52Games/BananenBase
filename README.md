# BananenBase
The BananenBase is a discord.js framework to make your own Discord bot!

It's very easy to use, with a good documentation and support for custom modules!

You can use one of the many modules that exist, but you can also make your own module! 

The new version of the BananenBase is **10 times** faster than the old version (without modules)!
